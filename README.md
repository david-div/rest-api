Ninjago, find a Ninja for hire in your area.

`npm install`

In the browser:  
http://localhost:4000/index.html

Ninja's can be added/updated/deleted in 2 ways:
 - through mongodb
 - using Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/)

Robo3T (https://robomongo.org/) was used as an in interface for mongodb.

Postman takes advantage of using the RESTful Api and was the reason for creating this app.
